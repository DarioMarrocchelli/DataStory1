# Data Story, Take 1

This repo contains my first data story. This is an assignement required for the Data Science Intensive workshop (https://www.mysliderule.com/workshops/data-science-intensive/).

In this assignment, I have taken a datset from FiveThirtyEight on food preferences in the US. The dataset is available from Mode Analytics (https://modeanalytics.com/cooldata/tables/fivethirtyeight_food_world_cup). I have manipulated this dataset with Pandas and extracted interesting information from it. After that, I have written a short story that summarizes the results in a language that should be understandable to a non-expert (I hope!).

The write-up can be found under DataStory_v0.1.ipynb (an ipython notebook with some text and three graphs). Most of the data analysis, including things that are not reported in the write-up, can be found in Data Analysis.ipynb.
